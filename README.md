Photo-To-Tweet
==============

Simple F# application which allows you to take a photo, add a sepia filter, and tweet it.

** Please note the demo needs to be ran on an iOS device. It will crash in the iOS simulator ***

Takes advantage of the Xamarin.Social component to handle attaching image and link to twitter post. This demo is iOS specific but could easily be converted to Android. If you want to see an Android project in here send me a tweet.
